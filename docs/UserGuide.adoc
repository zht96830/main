== Introduction

Personal Finance Tracker is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for expense tracking*. More importantly, Personal Finance Tracker is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Whether if you are an expert user or a non tech savvy user, we have commands that cater towards you guys!Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `main.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Personal Finance Tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`list`**`v/all` : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/Sofa $/200 c/HOME` : adds an expense named `Sofa` of amount `$200` and category of `HOME` to the Finance Tracker.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd expense shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Hamburger`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Hamburger t/lunch` or as `n/Hamburger`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/lunch`, `t/lunch t/happy hour` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME $/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY`, `$/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* We take into account non-tech savvy users and offer alternative command format that prompts users to add parameters step by step. +
e.g. When adding an expense, instead of inputting an entire line of command such as `add n/NAME $/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY [d/DATE] [r/REMARK]` (Format 1), we also allow user to type in command `add` and prompts the user to input each parameter one by one. (Format 2).
