== Introduction

Personal Finance Tracker is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for expense tracking*. More importantly, Personal Finance Tracker is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Whether if you are an expert user or a non tech savvy user, we have commands that cater towards you guys!Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `main.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Personal Finance Tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`list`**`v/all` : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/Sofa $/200 c/HOME` : adds an expense named `Sofa` with cost of `$200` and category of `HOME` to the Finance Tracker.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Hamburger`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Hamburger t/lunch` or as `n/Hamburger`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/lunch`, `t/lunch t/happy hour` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME $/COST c/CATEGORY`, `$/COST c/CATEGORY n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* We take into account for non tech savvy users and offer alternative commands that prompts users to add parameters step by step. e.g. In adding an expense, instead of inputting entire line of command such as `add n/NAME $/COST c/CATEGORY [d/DATE] [e/EXPLANATION]` (Format 1), we allow user to type in command `add` and prompts the user for each parameters (Format 2).
